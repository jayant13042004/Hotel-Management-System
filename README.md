The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive C++ application that efficiently handles various hotel operations. The system manages room reservations, check-ins, and check-outs, ensuring streamlined operations and customer satisfaction. Key features include:

Room Management: Add, search, and manage room details, including room type, size, and daily rent.
Customer Management: Store and retrieve customer information such as name, address, and booking details.
Reservation and Billing: Facilitate room bookings, track payments, and generate detailed billing reports.
Guest Summary Reports: Provide a summary of all guests currently checked in, enhancing hotel management efficiency.
This project, built using C++ and basic data structures, demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming and practical application development.
